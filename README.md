# Perceptron-AI
A python implementation of a perceptron (algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers)

A binary classifier is a function which can decide whether or not an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class.

In this case this perceptron uses as base model the classi iris data, which has 2 possible classification Iris-versicolor and Iris-setosa, and the differences are given by the size of the flower.
